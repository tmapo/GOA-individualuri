    <p> MMA is the sport which i got into recently, but sometimes i prefer it over every other sport. Few months ago, my mom saw the advertisement of GOA Martial Arts and straight away suggested it to me. I was excited to experience new things and agreed to join it. few months in I really started liking the sport, and already prefered it over football. I started watching UFC, and the first fight i watched was McGregor VS Khabib 2018. Later i found out about that story. Today im starving for more lessons, and waiting to start working out and learning patiently. </p>
