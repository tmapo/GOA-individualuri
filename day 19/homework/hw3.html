    <p> Chess is also one of my favourite sports. The story is very simple. My grandpa wanted me to learn chess, and i got into a Chess school. I had an old woman as a teacher. As soon as i got into the classroom, my teacher made me play with someone. I didnt even know how chess pieces moved, but she didnt pay attention. At home i told my grandpa about the situation , and he himself teached me everything. after that we started playing every afternoon. I wasnt the best at it, but he always made it interesting to play. After he passed away, i didnt pay much attention to chess. But about two months ago my interest in chess renewed. i started playing, watching and doing puzzles. I hope i become better.</p>
