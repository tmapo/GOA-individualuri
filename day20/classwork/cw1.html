    <h1>General information:</h1>
    <h2>Foundation</h2>
    <p>American Special Forces needed new viechles as their main transport on the battlefield. Thats when original Hummer was created. In 1992, M998 Humvee was created. It had many special features. Such as its amazingly massive width. Its width was calculated, so its tires would suit Tanks tire tracks. This made it easier to travel in extreme conditions. Using the cars width, engineers decided to leave flat space in middle of the interior. Soldiers would stand there to use their weapons from top of the car. </p>

    <h2>Hummers made for roads</h2>
    <p>In 1998, Hummer renewed its attention by releasing their first road-meant viechle - Hummer h1. from 1998 to 2010, Hummer made 3 different models: h1, h2 and h3.</p>
