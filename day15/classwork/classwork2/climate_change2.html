        <p>Because of us humans, many toxic gases are released in air, like CO2 or methane. CO2 is mostly produced because of burning fossil fuels, and methane because of cow and other animal farms. these gases act like a blanket around earth and trap heat. because of this, not only one day or week feels hot, but temperatures get higher and higher every year. </p>
